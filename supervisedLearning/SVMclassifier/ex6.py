#  This file contains code that helps you get started on the
#  exercise. You will need to complete the following functions:
#
#     gaussianKernel.m
#     dataset3Params.m
#     processEmail.m
#     emailFeatures.m
#
#  For this exercise, you will not need to change any code in this file,
#  or any other files other than those mentioned above.

#  =============== Part 1: Loading and Visualizing Data ================
#  We start the exercise by first loading and visualizing the dataset. 
#  The following code will load the dataset into your environment and plot
#  the data.

print('Loading and Visualizing Data ...')

# Load from ex6data1: 
# You will have X, y in your environment
data = scipy.io.loadmat('ex6data1.mat')
X = data['X']
y = data['y'].flatten()

# Plot training data
plotData(X, y)
show()

input('Program paused. Press Enter to continue...')

#  ==================== Part 2: Training Linear SVM ====================
#  The following code will train a linear SVM on the dataset and plot the
#  decision boundary learned.

# Load from ex6data1:
# You will have X, y in your environment
data = scipy.io.loadmat('ex6data1.mat')
X = data['X']
y = data['y'].flatten()

print('Training Linear SVM ...')

# You should try to change the C value below and see how the decision
# boundary varies (e.g., try C = 1000)

C = 1
clf = svm.SVC(C=C, kernel='linear', tol=1e-3, max_iter=20)
model = clf.fit(X, y)
visualizeBoundaryLinear(X, y, model)
show()

input('Program paused. Press Enter to continue...')

#  =============== Part 3: Implementing Gaussian Kernel ===============
#  You will now implement the Gaussian kernel to use
#  with the SVM. You should complete the code in gaussianKernel.m

print('Evaluating the Gaussian Kernel ...')

x1 = np.array([1, 2, 1])
x2 = np.array([0, 4, -1])
sigma = 2
sim = gaussianKernel(x1, x2, sigma)

print('Gaussian Kernel between x1 = [1 2 1], x2 = [0 4 -1], sigma = %0.5f : '
      '\t%f\n(this value should be about 0.324652)\n' % (sigma, sim))

input('Program paused. Press Enter to continue...')

#  =============== Part 4: Visualizing Dataset 2 ================
#  The following code will load the next dataset into your environment and
#  plot the data.

print('Loading and Visualizing Data ...')

# Load from ex6data2:
# You will have X, y in your environment
data = scipy.io.loadmat('ex6data2.mat')
X = data['X']
y = data['y'].flatten()

# Plot training data
plotData(X, y)
show()

#  ========== Part 5: Training SVM with RBF Kernel (Dataset 2) ==========
#  After you have implemented the kernel, we can now use it to train the
#  SVM classifier.
#
print('Training SVM with RBF Kernel (this may take 1 to 2 minutes) ...')

# Load from ex6data2:
# You will have X, y in your environment
data = scipy.io.loadmat('ex6data2.mat')

y = data['y'].flatten()

# SVM Parameters
C = 1
sigma = 0.1
gamma = 1.0 / (2.0 * sigma ** 2)

# We set the tolerance and max_passes lower here so that the code will run
# faster. However, in practice, you will want to run the training to
# convergence.

#  =============== Part 6: Visualizing Dataset 3 ================
#  The following code will load the next dataset into your environment and
#  plot the data.

print('Loading and Visualizing Data ...')

# Load from ex6data3:
# You will have X, y in your environment
data = scipy.io.loadmat('ex6data3.mat')
X = data['X']
y = data['y'].flatten()

# Plot training data
plotData(X, y)
show()

input('Program paused. Press Enter to continue...')

# ========== Part 7: Training SVM with RBF Kernel (Dataset 3) ==========
#  This is a different dataset that you can use to experiment with. Try
#  different values of C and sigma here.

# Load from ex6data3:
# You will have X, y in your environment
data = scipy.io.loadmat('ex6data3.mat')
Xval = data['Xval']
yval = data['yval'].flatten()

# Try different SVM Parameters here
C, sigma = dataset3Params(X, y, Xval, yval)
gamma = 1.0 / (2.0 * sigma ** 2)

# Train the SVM
clf = svm.SVC(C=C, kernel='rbf', tol=1e-3, max_iter=200, gamma=gamma)
model = clf.fit(X, y)
