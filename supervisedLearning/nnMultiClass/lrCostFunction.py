    # ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
    # Instructions: Compute the cost of a particular choice of theta.
    #               You should set J to the cost.
    #
    # Hint: The computation of the cost function and gradients can be
    #       efficiently vectorized. For example, consider the computation
    #
    #           sigmoid(X * theta)
    #
    #       Each row of the resulting matrix will contain the value of the
    #       prediction for that example. You can make use of this to vectorize
    #       the cost function and gradient computations.
