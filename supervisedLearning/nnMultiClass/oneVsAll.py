    # ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
    # Instructions: You should complete the following code to train num_labels
    #               logistic regression classifiers with regularization
    #               parameter lambda.
    #
    # Hint: theta(:) will return a column vector.
    #
    # Hint: You can use y == c to obtain a vector of 1's and 0's that tell use
    #       whether the ground truth is true/false for this class.
    #
    # Note: For this assignment, we recommend using fmincg to optimize the cost
    #       function. It is okay to use a for-loop (for c = 1:num_labels) to
    #       loop over the different classes.

    # Set Initial theta
    initial_theta = np.zeros((n + 1, 1))

    # This function will return theta and the cost
