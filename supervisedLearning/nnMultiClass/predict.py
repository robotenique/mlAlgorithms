    # ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
    # Instructions: Complete the following code to make predictions using
    #               your learned neural network. You should set p to a
    #               vector containing labels between 1 to num_labels.
    #
    # Hint: The max function might come in useful. In particular, the max
    #       function can also return the index of the max element, for more
    #       information see 'help max'. If your examples are in rows, then, you
    #       can use max(A, [], 2) to obtain the max for each row.
    #
    # =========================================================================

    return p + 1  # add 1 to offset index of maximum in A row
