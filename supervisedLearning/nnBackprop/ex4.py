#  your implementation is correct by verifying that you get the same cost
#  as us for the fixed debugging parameters.

#  We suggest implementing the feedforward cost *without* regularization
#  first so that it will be easier for you to debug. Later, in part 4, you
#  will get to implement the regularized cost.
