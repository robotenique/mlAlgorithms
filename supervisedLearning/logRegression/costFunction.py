# ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
# Instructions: Compute the cost of a particular choice of theta.
#               You should set J to the cost.
#               Compute the partial derivatives and set grad to the partial
#               derivatives of the cost w.r.t. each parameter in theta
#
# Note: grad should have the same dimensions as theta
