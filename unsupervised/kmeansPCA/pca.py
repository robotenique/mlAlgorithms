    # Instructions: You should first compute the covariance matrix. Then, you
    #               should use the "svd" function to compute the eigenvectors
    #               and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.
    #
    # Note: When computing the covariance matrix, remember to divide by m (the
    #       number of examples).
