Dear Hiring Manager,

It was with much interest that I read your April 8th [insert alternate date] job posting on Craigslist for an Assistant Communications Director. Your description of the work responsibilities incumbent upon your next Assistant Director closely match my experience, and so I am excited to submit my resume to you for your consideration.

In my position as an Assistant Communications Director for ABC Company, I wrote articles for the company website, managed the editing and posting of contributing articles, managed their social media presence, and wrote and sent out a weekly email newsletter to subscribers. I also implemented an automated email tool that grew their subscriber base by 40% within six months.

While Assistant Communications Director for Assemblyperson Janet Brown, I researched, drafted and amended legislation, wrote press releases, and was responsible for office communications and correspondence.

My resume is attached. If I can provide you with any further information on my background and qualifications, please let me know.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you for your consideration.
